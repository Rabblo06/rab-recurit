# Deploy-order real-container tests (test-only)

These tests prove the owner's "deploy exactly like Twenty" decision (2026-11-11) on real containers. They run the
production compose files unchanged, deployed with the documented command:

```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

They check three things:

1. One command updates `rab-api` and `rab-worker` together, from one variable (`CREWFLOW_IMAGE_TAG`, a `sha256:` digest).
2. The API starts first, migrates, registers the job schedulers and becomes healthy. The Worker starts only after that.
3. An old Worker never runs beside a new API. The Worker's `depends_on: rab-api: {condition: service_healthy, restart: true}`
   makes Compose stop it before it replaces the API.

Nothing here is a deployment file.

## Files

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `run-deploy-order-tests.cjs` | The driver. One PostgreSQL major per run. |
| `docker-compose.deploy-order.yml` | The infrastructure overlay. PostgreSQL and Redis data live on tmpfs, the TLS key gets 0600 inside the container, and the API publishes no host port. The app services are not changed. |
| `docker-compose.deploy-order-t4.yml` | For T4 only: a shorter API health-check window. The Worker's `depends_on` is unchanged. |

## The cases

| Case | What is proven |
|---|---|
| T1 | A fresh deploy of the previous digest. The `rab-api` `health_status: healthy` event comes before the `rab-worker` `start` event. `State.StartedAt` agrees. |
| T2 | A deploy of the new digest with the same command. Both containers are recreated on the same new digest. The old Worker's `die` event comes before the new API's `start` event. The new API applies the new migrations on start. The new Worker sees every scheduler. It runs the new code for a scheduled job: the email dispatch sweep prints `generationsExhausted=` (new in #89) when it claims a probe row. |
| T3 | A rollback with `CREWFLOW_IMAGE_TAG=<previous digest>` and the same command. Both containers go back together, in the same event order. The old API logs `database state AHEAD` and still serves `/healthz`. |
| T4 | The API fails its health check (a wrong `PG_EXPECTED_DATABASE_NAME`, set only in T4's own env file). The command exits non-zero with `dependency failed to start: ... is unhealthy`. `rab-worker` is created but never started (`State.StartedAt` = zero, no `start` event). |

## Running it

The images come from a **local** registry, so each has a real registry digest. Nothing is pushed to Docker Hub.

```bash
docker run -d --name deploy-order-registry -p 127.0.0.1:5055:5000 --tmpfs /var/lib/registry registry@sha256:<digest>
docker tag <previous image> 127.0.0.1:5055/adolphus:prev && docker push 127.0.0.1:5055/adolphus:prev
docker tag <new image>      127.0.0.1:5055/adolphus:new  && docker push 127.0.0.1:5055/adolphus:new

DOT_REPOSITORY=127.0.0.1:5055/adolphus DOT_PREV_DIGEST=sha256:<prev> DOT_NEW_DIGEST=sha256:<new> \
DOT_PG_IMAGE=postgres@sha256:<16 or 18> DOT_REDIS_IMAGE=redis@sha256:<7> \
  node packages/rab-docker/deploy-order-tests/run-deploy-order-tests.cjs <16|18> <out-dir>
```

On Git Bash for Windows, set `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` for the `docker run` line.

- **Projects and containers.** T1–T3 use project `dot-pg<major>` and T4 uses `dot-pg<major>-t4`. At most five of the run's containers run at once: PostgreSQL, Redis, the API, the Worker and the registry. The driver samples and records the peak.
- **No sink container.** SMTP and S3 point at `.invalid` names, so nothing leaves the host.
- **Cleanup.** The driver runs `docker compose down` on its own two projects only. It has no volumes (every data directory is a tmpfs), never prunes, and never touches another project. Remove the registry yourself with `docker rm -f deploy-order-registry`.
- **Secrets.** They are generated per run under `<out-dir>/secrets`, outside the repository, and reach the containers only through env files. Every captured output is redacted.
- **Output.** `<out-dir>/RESULTS.json`, `SUMMARY.md`, `run.log` and `evidence/`, which holds the event timelines, deploy output and container logs.
